## Description
A 3D point-and-click adventure & puzzle game geared towards children roughly between 8 to 14. Partly inspired by Osmosis Jones, a dangerous virus named Marberg has infected the city and only private investigator, Luke Holmes, can put a stop to it. Discover clues to Marberg's whereabouts by playing mini-games and solving puzzles (all while set to a jazzy soundtrack) to save Luke's city.
